# Joobu
The automated portfolio and resume builder.

### What is the purpose of Joobu?
Joobu seeks to kickstart one's career search by providing a resume and portfolio with just a few minutes of work.

### How does it work?
Joobu will ask about personal information and major events throughout one's career (job changes, public speaking, publications, etc). This information will then be compiled into a JSON file that is used to generate a static website and a resume PDF. 

As of the first release, the use will then download these files and find hosting for the site themselves. A future release of Joobu will be able to automatically deploy the portfolio website.

### What's up with this tech stack?
The use of plain HTML with Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS was choosen in order to quickly get something out in order to validate the idea. I highly believe in the approach of not over-engineering something to the point you give up on it. In fact, [I wrote an article on this](https://alexwhitedev.medium.com/the-art-of-validating-quickly-8b698c183f17).
